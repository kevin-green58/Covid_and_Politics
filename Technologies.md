# Technologies
This file provides details on the technologies our team will use. 

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
For initial exploratory data cleaning and analysis, Python was used to review and transform data. QuickDBD was used to model a hypothetical database.  

## Database Storage
Currently, our data is locally stored in csv files. Our team will discuss further which database storage method is best, based on further discussion on how we would like to present the data and our analysis. See the point below about our thoughts on our dashboard. 
 
## Machine Learning 
For the provisional machine learning model, Python was used in Jupyter Notebook. Pandas and SciKitLearn were the libraries used to create the provisional model. 

## Dashboard 
Our team has discussed using Tableau or Flask to present our data and analysis. Flask would require our team to use MongoDB as our database. Tableau would allow us to keep our data in csv format.
