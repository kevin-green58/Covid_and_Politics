## Overview
Using data acquired from multiple sources, we set out to discover if there are correlations with Covid 19 rates of infection and a group's political views, race or ethnicity, age, gender or economic status.  

To allow for the greatest possible diversity in our data, we drew our data from over 3000 counties in the United States. We retrieved our data on race, ethnicity, age, gender and economic status from the United States Census Bureau.  the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies (ASARB) provided our data for the religious affiliations of a counties population.  We used statistics from kaggle for details on individual countie's Covid 19 rates of infections and death rates. 

 - ### Purpose
To answer the question is there a correlation between Covid 19 transfer rates and a countie's population's political views, race or ethnicity make up, age, gender or economic status. We used statistics from kaggle for details on individual countie's Covid 19 rates of infections and death rates.

 - ### Project Breakdown
 The project was broken down into four segments.
   - Segment One: 
     - Flesh out overall project
     - Build a model of our fabricated database
     - Build a simple model for machine learning.
     - Role Breakdown:
       - Stephen Anayas-Hilliard:  Responsible for repository, intitial data research and clean up.
       - John Phillips: Mockup of machine learning model.
       - Isaac D. Tucker-Rasbury: Mockup of sample database.
       - Melyssa Sibal: Technologies used in each step of project
     - Segment Two:
       - Refine our database
       - Train our model
     - Segment Three:
       - Connect final database to our model.
       - Continue to train our model
       - Create dashboard and presentation
     - Segment Four:
       - Final touches on model, database and dashboard
